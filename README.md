# Web-Based-Checklist
# Overview

The goal of this software is to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to manage their tasks, improve productivity, and stay organized. The list may change and things simplified as I continue to work on this project, but this is what I think I can accomplish at this time.

Key features of the software will include:
1.	Task Creation and Editing: Users can add new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels. They can also edit existing tasks to update details or make changes.
2.	Task Prioritization: The application will allow users to prioritize tasks by assigning different levels such as high, medium, or low priority. This will help users focus on the most important tasks first.
3.	Task Organization: Users can organize their tasks into different lists or categories, making it easier to manage tasks related to various projects or activities.
4.	Task Completion Tracking: The application will provide features to mark tasks as complete once they are finished. Users can also view completed tasks for reference or to track their progress.
5.	Reminders and Notifications: Users can set reminders for important tasks or deadlines to ensure they are not missed. The application may also send notifications to users' devices to remind them of upcoming tasks or deadlines.

Here is the walkthrough for the software:
