# Overview

The goal of this software is to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to manage their tasks, improve productivity, and stay organized. The list may change and things simplified as I continue to work on this project, but this is what I think I can accomplish at this time.

Key features of the software will include:
1.	Task Creation and Editing: Users can add new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels. They can also edit existing tasks to update details or make changes.
2.	Task Organization: Users can organize their tasks into different lists, making it easier to manage tasks related to various projects or activities.
3.	Task Completion Tracking: The application will provide features to mark tasks as complete once they are finished. Users can also view completed tasks for reference or to track their progress.

Here is the walkthrough for the software:
